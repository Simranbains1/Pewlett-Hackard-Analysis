# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

This project is meant to help Pewlett-Hackard prepare for an upcoming mass retirement, or "silver tsunami". In order to make an effective plan, we must be able to manipulate the tables to create easy-to-follow results. There are also many different criteria to search from to ensure that anyone using the data can find the information they need. For example, a department manager can sort by their department to understand how many positions will need to be filled over the comming months.

For the specifics of this project, we sorted retiring employees by their job title and created a table to identify candidates that would thrive in the mentorship program. For context, these are the relationships between different tables that we created in order to formulate the best combination of data for a particular query.

  - The largest group of employees retiting by title are Senior Engineers. This is closely followed by general Senior Staff. 
  - Vigorous efforts must be made to prioritize Senior positions, and the company must make the decision to focus on internal promotions or new employees joining the company at the Senior level.
  - 1,549 employees qualify for the mentorship program, but there are many more retiring employees that don't qualify. 
  - A decision must be made in creating a smooth transition for retiring providers and the employees that will be taking their place.



## Summary: 

"How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?"
  - 90,000+ positions need to be filled as the silver tsunami starts impacting the company. 
"Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?"
  - Only a very very small percentage of the upcoming retirees qualify as a potential mnentors.
  
The silver tsunami does not need to be overwhelming or impossible. Looking at the information below, we see that the from-date varies, which will cause staggered retirements instead of a mass exodus.

Lastly, the mentorship program can be successful with a small percentage of the retirees actually qualifying. Remote contact can be applied to several different employees that are taking on a Senior level position. It also creates an opportunity to standardize bestpractice policies and update the workforce as needed.
